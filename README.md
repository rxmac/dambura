# Dambura - A Free Stencil Font

Dambura is a stencil font made from primitive shapes. It follows a few simple rules to create a minimal and predictable letterforms. It’s strictly for display use and is perfect for punchy retro titles.

Dambura is the first full font that I’ve made (hence why it’s so bloody basic!). Its creation was randomly inspired by the use of Futura Black in a scene in the movie ‘The Zodiac’. I also built a little microsite (hosted on gh-pages) to show it off.
